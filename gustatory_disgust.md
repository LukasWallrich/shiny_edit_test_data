* _Replication effect size:_ Johnson et al.: Cohen’s  _d_ = 0.04 (Study 1 -  comparison to control group), Cohen’s  _d_ = 0.05 (Study 2 -  comparison to control group).  All effect sizes are located in Ghelfi et al. 2016: comparison to sweet group: Christopherson: Hedges _g_ = 0.53;  Christopherson: Hedges’ _g_ = 0.04; Fischer: Hedges’ _g_ = 0.25; Guberman: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.30; de Haan: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.13; Legate: Hedges’ _g_ = 0.99; Legate: Hedges’ _g _= -0.02; Lenne: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.19;  Urry: Hedges’ _g_ =  -0.13;  Wagemans: Hedges’ _g_ = 0.03; Weber: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.27.  Meta-analytic estimate: Hedges’ _g_ =  -0.05. Comparison to control group:  Christopherson: Hedges _g_ = 0.68;  Christopherson: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.19; Fischer: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.01; Guberman: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.12; de Haan: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.24; Legate: Hedges’ _g_ = 0.79; Legate: Hedges’ _g _= 0.37; Lenne: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.13;  Urry: Hedges’ _g_ =  0.08;  Wagemans: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.11; Weber: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.04.  Meta-analytic estimate: Hedges’ _g_ =  0.10.
