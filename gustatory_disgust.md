    * Original effect size:_ _Cohen’s _d _= 1.12 (comparison to control group) Cohen’s  _d _= 1.28 (comparison to sweet taste).
    * Replication effect size: Johnson et al.: Cohen’s  _d_ = 0.04 (Study 1 -  comparison to control group), Cohen’s  _d_ = 0.05 (Study 2 -  comparison to control group).

Meta-analytic estimate: Hedges’ _g_ =  -0.05. Comparison to control group:  Christopherson: Hedges _g_ = 0.68;  Christopherson: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.19; Fischer: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.01; Guberman: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.12; de Haan: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.24; Legate: Hedges’ _g_ = 0.79; Legate: Hedges’ _g _= 0.37; Lenne: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.13;  Urry: Hedges’ _g_ =  0.08;  Wagemans: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.11; Weber: Hedges’ _g_ = -0.04.
